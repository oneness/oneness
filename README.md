### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I occasionally blog about programming [**here.**](https://www.birkey.co/archive.html)

**Note**: I am not currently available for hire and do not engage with third-party recruiters. However, if your company prioritizes rapid feedback cycles, developer productivity through effective tooling, APIs, and robust platforms, as well as a functional approach to problem-solving, Iâ€™d be open to exploring how we can collaborate on tackling complex challenges.
