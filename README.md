### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I occasionally blog about programming [**here.**](https://www.birkey.co/archive.html)

**Note**: I am **NOT** currently available for hire and do **NOT** respond to
third party recruiters. However, if your company values fast feedback cycle, developer productivity via great tooling and functional approach to problem solving, I'd be interested in spending sometime together to solve tough problems.
