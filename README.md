### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I occasionally blog about programming [**here.**](https://www.birkey.co/archive.html)

I enjoy building information systems that just work, which can only
be achieved by keeping IT as simple as IT can be. If you are into
Clojure, Common Lisp, Guile, Erlang/Elixir, Haskell, F#, OCaml, Ada, Prolog, Forth and APL or any other programming languages that jolts your
brain to think, shock me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KasimTuman).

**Note**: I am **NOT** currently available for hire and do **NOT** respond to
third party recruiters. However, if your company values fast feedback cycle, developer productivity via great tooling and functional approach to problem solving, I'd be interested in spending sometime together to solve tough problems.
